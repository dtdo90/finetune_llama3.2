      "Llamas are herbivores, which means they primarily feed on plant-based foods. Their diet typically consists of:\n",

      "1. Grasses: Llamas love to graze on various types of grasses, including tall grasses, short grasses, and even weeds.\n",
      "2. Hay: High-quality hay, such as alfalfa or timothy hay, is a staple in a llama's diet. They enjoy the sweet taste and texture of fresh hay.\n",
      "3. Grains: Llamas may receive grains like oats, barley, or corn as part of their daily ration. However, it's essential to provide these grains in moderation, as they can be high in calories.\n",
      "4. Fruits and vegetables: Llamas enjoy a variety of fruits and veggies, such as apples, carrots, sweet potatoes, and leafy greens like kale or spinach.\n",
      "5. Minerals: Llamas require access to mineral supplements, which help maintain their overall health and well-being.\n",

      "1. Leaves: They'll munch on leaves from trees and shrubs, including plants like willow, alder, and birch.\n",
      "2. Bark: In some cases, llamas may eat the bark of certain trees, like aspen or cottonwood.\n",
      "3. Mosses and lichens: These non-vascular plants can be a tasty snack for llamas.\n",
      "\n",
      "In captivity, llama owners typically provide a balanced diet that includes a mix of hay, grains, and fruits/vegetables. It's essential to consult with a veterinarian or experienced llama breeder to determine the best feeding plan for your llama.\n"
